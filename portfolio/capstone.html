                <h2>Overview</h2>
                  <p>Each Spring and Fall sesmester, the College of Computing and Software Engineering hosts their Hackathon event &mdash; where local companies sponsor teams of students all competing to win prizes, recognition, and possible career opportunities. At the time of this project, the current method of managing sponsors, students, and event details required the use of multiple programs and put a large strain on the event coordinators.</p>
                <p>Our goal for this project was to create a single web applicaiton that would allow students to register for the event, set up teams, and select their own sponsors. Our system also had adminstrative capabilities such as team management, event and sponsor updates, event scheduling, and more.</p>

                    </aside>
                    <p>During the planning phase, we quickly realized that our team had complimentary skills. This allowed us to effectively design each element of the application in a way that would ensure that they work together. The requirements given to us by the client were as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Students must be able to create accounts and manage their information</li>
                        <li>Students must be able to create and manage their teams</li>
                        <li>Teams must be able to register for sponsors/programs</li>
                        <li>Admin must be able to manage events and sponsor selection</li>
                        <li>Admin must bea able to declare and display winning teams</li>
                        <li>Technical and user documentation must be provided for handoff in Spring 2021</li>
                        <li>Create a Discord server that will serve as an online community (optional)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The only material we were provided to complete this project was a remote server running Ubuntu 18.04. Thankfully, we had all had some degree of experience with Ubuntu, and were therefore able to set up preliminary databases and host our site files with little to no issue. From here, we broke the project up into three milestones:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Account registration</strong> &mdash; creating a webform and accompanying database that allowed a collection of important data; populate student dashboard</li>
                        <li><strong>Admin capabilities</strong> &mdash; creating a separate administrator login and dashboard with required functionalities</li>
                        <li><strong>Final working solution</strong> &mdash; finish out base features and create handoff/technical documentation</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Each milestone was approximately 4 weeks long, with weekly meetings with our client/sponsor to ensure our project was on the right path.</p>
                </div>
              
              <h2 class="col-12 mt-5">Development Phase</h2>
              <div class="col-12">
                  <p>This was where the real fun began. We immediately began creating wireframes and a style guide for each of our necessary pages. Our client had asked us to include the school's colors &mdash; gold and black &mdash; and other branding elements into our site design. I also wanted to ensure that our site was responsive, so I developed our project using Bootstrap. This allowed us to create robust, responsive designs with relative ease.</p>
                  
                  <h4>Milestone One</h4>
                  <aside class="float-right bg-info p-5 ml-4 d-none d-lg-block" style="width:300px;">
                      SIDE BY SIDE OF WIREFRAME OF FORM VS ACTUAL FORM BY THE END OF THE MILESTONE
                  </aside>
                  <p>In the first milestone, our priorities were on creating a functional registration form and user dashboard. In order to get a baseline understanding of what data we needed to collect, we examined the registration form that was currently being used. We then drew out a wireframe for the form, structured out our databases, and connected them with the developed webform. After running a few tests and patching a few bugs, our form was about as done as we could get it.</p>
                  <p>We then shifted our focus to account authentication and population of the dashboard. While Matt and Carter worked on the authentication, I teamed up with Zachary to develop the dashboard. We created a multi-sectioned page with alloted containers for features we planned to execute later in the semester. Some of those features were never touched on, though, due to time constraints. However, we did ensure that the core features &mdash; viewing/editing team information, viewing/editing personal information, account management, etc. &mdash; were fleshed out to the fullest extent we could get them.</p>
                  <h4>Milestone Two</h4>
                  <aside class="float-right bg-info p-5 ml-4 d-none d-lg-block" style="width:300px;">

                  </aside>
                  <p>As we transitioned into our second milestone, we realized that many of the features we planned to implement were more labor-intensive than planned. This lead to us narrowing our project's scope to ensure our client recieved a working product. Our main focus for this section became </p>
